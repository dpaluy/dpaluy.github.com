<p>You have to visit at least one Ruby conference in USA! Check this <a href="#summary">summary</a></p>

<h2>SteelCity Ruby</h2>

<p>At the beginning of this year (2013) I decided that I have to participate in at least one international Ruby conference.
I already participated in Development conferences in Europe and even did several talks. But I have never been in USA Ruby conference yet.</p>

<p>Some one tweeted about <a href="http://steelcityruby.org/">SteelCity Ruby</a> conference and I decided to register immediately.
I found amazing appartment via <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/tell-a-friend?airef=2idrtz00414zz5">AirBnB</a> just near the venue for a half price of a room in hotel.</p>

<p>Pittsburgh is a very nice city with amazing Ruby community. They have a pub inside a church (The Church Brew Works)</p>

<p>and Pittsburgh Sandwich with French fries</p>

<p>But let's go back to the Ruby. Did you know that <a href="http://www.steveklabnik.com/" target="_blank">Steve Klabnik</a> lived in Pittsburgh till last year?</p>

<p>I really like the "community feel" of this event. The organizers did amazing job! It's all done by local volunteers with help of sponsors.</p>

<p>I was introduced to other at the beginning of first day, when the conference moderator asked, who did more than 10,000 miles to arrive to that event.</p>

<p>I met a lot of great developers and had some #RubyFriends <a href="https://twitter.com/robbkidd/status/368384756217413633" target="_blank">pictures</a>. BTW, if you still don't have a <a href="http://rubyfriends.com/" target="_blank">RubyFriends picture</a>, go to a local meetup and do at least one!</p>

<p>I had an interesting talk with founder of <a href="https://www.gittip.com/" target="_blank">Gittip</a> Chad Whitacre. He founded amazing product to support Open Source community.</p>

<p>I also invited <a href="http://about.avdi.org/">Avdi Grimm</a> to come to Israel and give a talk in one of our events.</p>
